# Pomodoro-Clock

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a time management system where you work for a period of time then take a short break, then work for a period of time then take a short break, and so on.

This pomodoro clock will count down twenty-five minutes of work, indicate it is break time, count down five minutes, then start over again.

Made to learn/practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
